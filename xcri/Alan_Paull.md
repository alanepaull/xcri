I am a freelance information management consultant with my own company,
APS Ltd, that started in 1998. I specialise in information management in
the education sector, particularly HE. I have particular interests in
systems thinking and process improvements. I've worked on courses
information management for many years, particularly using SGML and XML.
I was one of the authors and developers of the eXchanging Course Related
